# Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview

This update implements a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system for your BookingGPT application, fixing the RLS policy error and enabling team management.

## What Changed

### 1. **Database Schema Updates**

#### Modified Trigger Function
- **File**: `contacts-schema-production.sql`
- **Change**: First user becomes `admin` automatically, subsequent users become `agent`
- **Impact**: Workspace owner gets full admin access

#### New RLS Policies for Contacts
- **Admins**: Can view, create, update, and delete ALL contacts
- **Agents**: Can only manage their OWN contacts
- **Clients**: Read-only access (to be implemented)

### 2. **New Features**

#### Team Management Page (`/team`)
- View all team members
- Change user roles (admin/agent/client)
- Generate invite links for new members
- **Access**: Admin only

#### Invite System
- **Invite Form**: Generate secure invite links with role assignment
- **Invite Page** (`/auth/invite`): Accept invites and create accounts
- **Token Validation**: 24-hour expiration on invite links

#### Role Hook (`useRole`)
- Check current user's role
- Helper booleans: `isAdmin`, `isAgent`, `isClient`
- Auto-refresh on mount

### 3. **Updated Pages**

#### Signup Page
- Shows info about admin role for first user
- Explains invite system for existing workspaces

## Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Fix Your Current User (IMMEDIATE FIX)

**Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- File: QUICK-FIX-UPDATE-USER-TO-ADMIN.sql
UPDATE public.users SET role = 'admin' WHERE id = auth.uid();
SELECT id, email, role FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

✅ **This fixes your RLS error immediately!**

### Step 2: Update RLS Policies

**Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- File: UPDATE-RLS-POLICIES.sql
-- (Copy entire contents of UPDATE-RLS-POLICIES.sql and execute)
```

This updates:
- ✅ All contacts RLS policies to role-based
- ✅ Trigger function to make first user admin
- ✅ Verification queries

### Step 3: Test the Fix

1. **Try creating a contact** - Should work now!
2. **Navigate to `/team`** - You should see your team management page
3. **Generate an invite link** - Test the invite flow

## How It Works

### User Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **admin** | Full access to all contacts, quotes, invoices. Can manage team members. |
| **agent** | Can only manage their own contacts. Perfect for team members. |
| **client** | Read-only access (to be fully implemented). |

### RLS Policy Logic

**For Admins:**
```sql
EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin')
```

**For Agents:**
```sql
auth.uid() = user_id AND
EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'agent')
```

### Invite Flow

1. **Admin generates invite link** → `/team` page
2. **Link contains**: email + role + timestamp (base64 encoded)
3. **Recipient clicks link** → `/auth/invite?token=...`
4. **Recipient creates account** → Role assigned automatically
5. **Admin can adjust role** → From team management page

## Security Features

✅ **Row-Level Security (RLS)** - Database-level access control
✅ **Role Validation** - Every query checks user role
✅ **Token Expiration** - Invite links expire after 24 hours
✅ **Email Verification** - Supabase requires email confirmation
✅ **Password Requirements** - Minimum 6 characters

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Optional)
- [ ] Email sending for invites (Supabase Edge Function)
- [ ] Invite token table (instead of URL encoding)
- [ ] Team member removal
- [ ] Audit log for role changes
- [ ] Client role permissions

### Phase 3 (Optional)
- [ ] Multi-workspace support
- [ ] Custom permissions per user
- [ ] Team-based contact sharing
- [ ] Advanced invite options (expiry customization)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "RLS policy violation" error
**Fix**: Run `QUICK-FIX-UPDATE-USER-TO-ADMIN.sql`

### "Access Denied" on /team page
**Check**: Verify your role is 'admin' in Supabase Table Editor

### Invite link expired
**Solution**: Generate new invite link (they expire after 24 hours)

### Can't see other users' contacts
**Expected**: Agents can only see their own contacts. Make yourself admin.
